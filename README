to 9.26
there are 4 weeks left

what we wanna do is list below:

1> user(role) - questions - answers
    all related crud | tests stuff
2> notifications
    now we have 2 kind(s) of notifications:
    -new answers to user's questions
    -messages in this site
3> emails stuff
    user(teacher) have ability to send emails to other users
4> about authentications stuff
5> frontend stuff

is there anything left? please add them below:
---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------

with things above, we can break them into 2 parts:
-backend
    1> finish 70% I think
    2> we have this under control
    so these 2 things we can have them all done before 9.4, ok? we can make a detail list here:

    3> email 1-3 days, but I don't think it's a difficult thing
    4> this maybe should take us more time, but we still can have this done before 9.12

    so, we can have all these 4 points in 2 weeks
-frontends
    2 weeks



to-do list:
1. change global methdo to monkey patch Array method in initialize files( try find why doesn't work last time )

8.29:

notice model
- quesions's owner will receive a notice when a answer created
    ..... -messages in this site

9.2:
- list all notifications of user( this may cost some time )
- finish notification part

9.5
almost finish above
I think we should remove email part for so many reasons,
and I can give a solution to that, We can build in-site message system,
so if you want to send message to someone, just use the message system
then get these all done before 9.12 as planed
